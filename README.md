# BeanAudio
<p>This is an app designed to run on an arduino device with a buzzer, vibrator, button, magnetic sensor, and light sensor. This was developed specifically with the Light Blue Bean +.</p>
<p>The program operates in the following way:</p>
<ol>
  <li>When run, the program waits for the button to be pressed.</li>
  <li>Once pressed, the program will play the most famous melody from Dvorak's New World Symphony.</li>
  <li>If the button is pressed mid-song, it restarts the song.</li>
  <li>If a magnet is held against the magnetic sensor while the song is playing, the vibrator will vibrate with the pitches.</li>
  <li>The light sensor will fluctuate the tempo that the music plays at depending on light intensity. The more luminous, the faster, and vice-versa.</li>
 </ol>
 <em>This progam was developed in C.</em>
